Asciigram
=========

Asciigram was the layton.rb 04-16-2013 meeting Code Kata. It takes a set
of movement and print commands and creates an ascii image. I initially
completed it as a simple single file ruby script. I then decided I
wanted to try minitest and to refactor the script into using Objects and
clean up my initial code. Each commit is a step of the refactoring.
